🚀 n8n Supercharged - The Complete Automation Powerhouse
Transform your n8n from a simple connector into a complete automation powerhouse!
This is a battle-tested, production-ready n8n Docker setup that includes 15+ essential npm packages for document generation, web scraping, image processing, data manipulation, and advanced automation workflows.
